Prebuilt HTML and CSS. Again built using vanilla JavaScript. Here I used Google to find a workable solution to the main functionality of the challenege. I also implemented a perceived minor UX improvment, i.e. disabling user select. Here, without disabling user select, the functionality to select multiple checkboxes causes text to be selected when multiple check boxes are checked.
